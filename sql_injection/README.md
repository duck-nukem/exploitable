# SQL Injection

This is a very basic example of an application prone to SQL injection.

## How to install

### Requirements:
* Example was written using Python 3 - at this point no compatibility is provided with Python 2.x

1. Install the requirements (preferably to a virtual environment) with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the app with `python sql_injection.py`
3. Access the app on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

### Notes:

* `queries.http` can be run from JetBrains IDEs, to test the API 
   *  `login.json` contains the payload for a valid login
   *  `invalid.json` contains the payload for an invalid login
   *  `injection.json` contains the payload for an SQL injection
* `schema.sql` contains the SQL required to build the database for this (it shouldn't be required, as `database.db` should contain the required data already)
