# exploitable

Exploitable is a way for me to learn hacking, by creating vulnerable 
applications at first, then trying to break them. 

I also plan to write articles for them, so maybe they can be helpful to 
anyone else who is a complete beginner.

## Structure

Each folder contains an exploitable app, and something to break it.
